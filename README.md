# AZUE Perfume House —— Frontend

Frontend application for the AZUE Perfume House e-commerce platform.

AZUE Perfume is a full-stack e-commerce application for selling authentic perfumes online. The customer-facing application allows users to browse perfumes, explore product details and variants, read perfume-related blog articles, manage their accounts, and place orders.

The project also includes an administration panel for managing the business, including product and inventory management, blog content, customer accounts, orders, and business reports. The application uses stateless authentication with JWT-based access and refresh tokens.

The project may be expanded in the future with additional e-commerce and business management capabilities.
